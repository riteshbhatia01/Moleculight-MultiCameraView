Work done in this practice exercise is:

On startup, start only Cam 0 start
Tap on the Cam 0 button to start (or stop) Cam 0
Tap on the Cam 1 button to start (or stop) Cam 1
Display the real-time frames-per-second of the live camera(s) or ‘idle’ if not running
Freeze the image when a camera is stopped
Allow both cameras to run simultaneously
Tap the Save button to capture and save the current live image(s) to the picture library (include the
Camera number and date+time in the file name)
Be able to run the app on a device using Android 7.1 (Nougat)
